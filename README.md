## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Our app is a platform that enables individuals and organisations to contribute to reduce greenhouse gases in the atomosphere through voluntary carbon offsetting. It allows any entity to (1) obtain funding for new green projects and (2) further monetise existing green projects that have already began consistently removing CO2 from environment.

The focus is primarily on the voluntary market where anyone can fund new projects or support existing projects by buying carbon credits sold by these companies on our platform. Our focus is not on the compliance market, which involves the trading of carbon credits between companies that have hit their carbon credit cap set by government and wish to buy carbon credits from other companies with surplus carbon credits (i.e., companies whose carbon credits are below the cap set by government).

## Built With 
- [Next.Js] (https://nextjs.org/) (React Web Framework)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Initial Setup

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### Local Development
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
